Based on the current features of DataClean Pro, here are
  several suggestions for new data cleaning and analysis features that
  would significantly enhance its capabilities, categorized for clarity:

  1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing


   * Advanced Text Cleaning: Go beyond basic string operations with a
     dedicated text cleaning module.
       * Regex Cleaner: Allow users to provide a regular expression to
         find and replace patterns in text columns (e.g., removing special
          characters, extracting specific substrings).
       * Stopword Removal: For text analysis, provide an option to remove
         common stopwords (like "the", "a", "is") from a text column, with
          support for multiple languages.
       * Punctuation Removal: A one-click option to strip all punctuation
         from a text column.


   * More Outlier Detection Methods:
       * Z-Score Method: Implement outlier detection based on the Z-score,
          allowing users to define a threshold (e.g., Z-score > 3) to
         identify and handle outliers. This provides an alternative to the
          current IQR method.


   * Advanced Imputation Strategies:
       * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation: For missing numeric values,
          use the values of the 'k' most similar rows to impute the
         missing data. This is often more accurate than simple mean/median
          imputation.
       * Model-Based Imputation: Use a simple regression model to predict
         and fill in missing values based on other columns.

  2. Data Transformation & Feature Engineering


   * Date/Time Feature Extraction:
       * If a datetime column exists, allow users to automatically
         generate new features from it, such as:
           * Day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday)
           * Month (e.g., January, February)
           * Year, Quarter, Week of the year
           * A binary feature for is_weekend

   * Text-Based Feature Engineering:
       * Automatically create numeric features from text columns, such as:
           * Word count
           * Character count
           * Average word length


   * Polynomial/Interaction Features:
       * Allow users to select two or more numeric columns and generate
         interaction terms (e.g., col1 * col2) or polynomial features
         (e.g., col1^2) to help capture non-linear relationships for
         machine learning models.

  3. Advanced Analysis & AI/ML


   * Automated Model Building (AutoML-lite):
       * Add a new tab where a user can select a target variable and a set
          of features, and the application will:
           1. Automatically train a few baseline models (e.g., Logistic
              Regression for classification, Linear Regression for
              regression).
           2. Display key performance metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Confusion
              Matrix for classification; R-squared, MSE for regression).
           3. Show a simple feature importance plot.


   * Clustering Analysis (Unsupervised Learning):
       * Implement K-Means clustering to allow users to segment their
         data. The user could select the features and the number of
         clusters (k), and the app would return a new cluster column and
         visualize the results (e.g., with a scatter plot colored by
         cluster).


   * Dimensionality Reduction:
       * Integrate Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Users could select
         a set of numeric features, and the app would perform PCA, show a
         scree plot (to visualize explained variance), and allow users to
         view the data in the new principal component space.

  4. Usability & Quality of Life


   * Recipe/Pipeline Export:
       * Allow users to "save" the sequence of cleaning and transformation
          steps they've applied. This "recipe" could then be exported
         (e.g., as a JSON file or a Python script) and re-applied to new,
         similar datasets, promoting reproducibility.


   * Project/State Saving:
       * Enable users to save their entire session state (the uploaded
         data, the history of changes, etc.) to a file. They could then
         load this file later to continue their work exactly where they
         left off.


  These features would elevate DataClean Pro from an excellent data
  cleaning tool to a more comprehensive, end-to-end data analysis and
  machine learning prototyping platform.




Here is a breakdown of the libraries and frameworks
  needed to implement the suggested features, categorized for clarity.

  Core Machine Learning & Statistics


  For most of the advanced analysis, machine learning, and statistical
  features, the `scikit-learn` and `scipy` libraries are essential. Your
   project already includes them, but you would be using more modules
  from them.


   * Library: scikit-learn
   * Features Supported:
       * Advanced Imputation: sklearn.impute.KNNImputer and
         sklearn.impute.IterativeImputer.
       * Polynomial/Interaction Features:
         sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.
       * AutoML-lite:
           * Models: sklearn.linear_model (e.g., LinearRegression,
             LogisticRegression), sklearn.ensemble (e.g.,
             RandomForestClassifier).
           * Metrics: sklearn.metrics (e.g., accuracy_score,
             confusion_matrix, r2_score).
       * Clustering: sklearn.cluster.KMeans.
       * Dimensionality Reduction: sklearn.decomposition.PCA.

   * Library: scipy
   * Features Supported:
       * Z-Score Outlier Detection: scipy.stats.zscore.


  Advanced Text Processing

  To handle more sophisticated text cleaning tasks like stopword
  removal, you would need a dedicated Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  library.


   * Library: nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
   * Why: It's a standard and powerful library for NLP tasks. It's
     relatively easy to integrate for specific tasks like managing
     stopwords.
   * Features Supported:
       * Stopword Removal: nltk.corpus.stopwords.
       * Tokenization & Stemming/Lemmatization: (Future enhancements)
         nltk.tokenize and nltk.stem.


   * Alternative: spaCy
   * Why: spaCy is a modern, fast, and production-ready NLP library. It
     can be an excellent alternative if you plan to add even more advanced
      NLP features in the future.

  State & Pipeline Management


  To implement features for saving and exporting your workflow, you
  would need a robust serialization library.


   * Library: dill
   * Why: dill can serialize a wider range of Python objects than the
     built-in pickle, including session states and complex objects that
     might be created in your application. This makes it ideal for saving
     the entire project state.
   * Features Supported:
       * Project/State Saving: Saving the entire st.session_state object
         to a file.
       * Recipe/Pipeline Export: Saving complex scikit-learn pipeline
         objects that encapsulate the entire workflow.

  Summary of New Dependencies to Add

  To implement all the suggested features, you would need to add the
  following to your requirement.txt and pyproject.toml:


   1. `nltk`: For advanced text cleaning.
   2. `dill`: For saving the project state and exporting processing
      pipelines.


  Your existing dependencies (scikit-learn, scipy, pandas) will cover
  the rest of the new functionality.
